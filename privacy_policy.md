# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the CMA Stock app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ahmad Ramsi (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use
The Application requires users to log in using an **email and password**. These accounts are **pre-created by the Service Provider** and are intended solely for internal use within the company.

- Users cannot register or create new accounts through the Application.  

In addition, the Application may allow users to optionally provide:  
- **Name**  
- **Profile photo**  

These optional details are used only to personalize the Application experience (e.g., displaying a profile name or image). They are not mandatory and do not affect access to the Application’s core functionality.  

Other than login credentials and optional profile details, the data stored in the Application relates only to **items or products** that are required for the Application’s functionality. This data is not connected to any individual user’s personal identity.

## Third-Party Services
