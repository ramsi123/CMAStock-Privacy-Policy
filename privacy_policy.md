# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the CMA Stock app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ahmad Ramsi (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use
The Application requires users to log in using an **email and password**. These accounts are **pre-created by the Service Provider** and are intended solely for internal use within the company.  
- The login information is used only for authentication and to provide access to the Application’s features.  
- Users cannot register or create new accounts through the Application.  

The Application may also allow users to optionally provide:  
- **Name**  
- **Profile photo**  

These optional details are used only to personalize the Application experience and are not mandatory.  

In addition, the Application allows authorized users to store **customer information** that is necessary for processing orders. This may include:  
- Customer name  
- Customer address  

This customer information is entered manually by the user and is used only for order management and internal business operations. It is not shared with any third party outside the services listed below.

Other than login credentials, optional profile details, and customer order data, the Application stores only **non-personal item/product data** that is required for its functionality.

## Third-Party Services
